# e-bergi

e-bergi is a tech blog which resides [here](http://e-bergi.com).

This repo is an attempt to swap its setup for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Since e-bergi is a system with many editors and authors, a `bergi-cms` is expected to mount the static generator.

Here is a rough *roadmap* for anyone who wants to help:

- [ ] finish reading Hugo docs

- [x] generate author profiles and articles
	- [x] author profiles with their respective articles
	- [x] multiple authors
	- [x] single article page
- [ ] generate the index page, about page, categories
	- [x] index
	- [ ] about
	- [ ] categories

- [ ] dress pages
- [ ] start making cms
