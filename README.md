# e-bergi

e-bergi is a tech blog which resides [here](http://e-bergi.com).

This repo is an attempt to swap its setup for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

All content is expected in the form of Articles(yazi) and Author profiles(yazar). Every other page should be generated from those files.

Since e-bergi is a system with many editors and authors, a `bergi-cms` is expected to mount the static generator.

Here is a rough *roadmap* for anyone who wants to help:

- [ ] finish reading Hugo docs
- [ ] generate author profiles and articles
- [ ] generate the index page, about page, categories

- [ ] dress pages
- [ ] start making cms
